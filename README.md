# Schrwite

Schrwite is a scite theme for gtksourceview. 
It isnt done yet, but it currently gives the 'feeling' of scite.

To install it, run:

```makefile
make install
```

Or place it in the correct directory by yourself.

Scrwite is tweaked to support makefiles and c files. It should look pretty much the same in other languages.
